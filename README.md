Simple spoof service for supported apps. Requires a key combination via native Calculator app to toggle the spoofing. Default code is 42069 (then equal key) to hide and unhide.

Requires Cydia/jailbroken iOS device, AppList, and iOS 8+ to function properly.

Open source project. Contribute as you wish; I'm developing this at a friend's request.
